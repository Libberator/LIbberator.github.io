in a flash of genius discovered the fundamental formula for quaternion multiplication:
i2 = j2 = k2 = ijk = -1
—Plaque on Broom Bridge, Dublin # Intro So you want to learn about quaternions? Well, you&amp;rsquo;ve come to the right place. I&amp;rsquo;ll try my best to simplify it for you.

No, I don&amp;rsquo;t mean that in the &amp;ldquo;you&amp;rsquo;re in trouble&amp;rdquo; sense, but more literally: we need to be able to communicate more clearly. When something is written in text, it can be hard to determine the *intent* behind the words or where they&amp;rsquo;re coming from.</description></item><item><title>Archives</title><link>https://libberator.github.io/archives/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libberator.github.io/archives/</guid><description/></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://libberator.github.io/about-me/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libberator.github.io/about-me/</guid><description>Oh, hello there!
I&amp;rsquo;m Libbs
I&amp;rsquo;m a gamedev hobbyist and a moderator for a gamedev/programming Discord channel with over 4k members.
My prior work was in Logistics, my education was Electrical Engineering, but my passion is in programming, problem-solving, and teaching.
I hope to share some of the things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned here, or be able to use this site as a reference for frequently asked questions or recurring topics.
Thanks for stopping by my lab!</description></item><item><title>Search</title><link>https://libberator.github.io/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://libberator.github.io/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
