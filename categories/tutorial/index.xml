And that intrigued me. It&amp;rsquo;s such a unique problem. They wanted something similar to Tarodev&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Roll-A-Cube&amp;rdquo; video.
Searching for a pre-existing solution to see if this had been done before turned up nothing. So I got to work. Engineering a solution to a unique problem involves trial and error, and I&amp;rsquo;ve purposefully included any non-working attempts so that you can follow along with the process.</description></item></channel></rss>
