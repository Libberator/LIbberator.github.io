Oh, hello there!

I'm Libbs

I'm a gamedev hobbyist and a moderator for a gamedev/programming Discord channel with over 4k members.

My prior work was in Logistics, my education was Electrical Engineering, but my passion is in programming, problem-solving, and teaching.

I hope to share some of the things I've learned here, or be able to use this site as a reference for frequently asked questions or recurring topics.

Thanks for stopping by my lab!
