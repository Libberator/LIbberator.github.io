A member of a Discord server I moderate was curious about how to roll a tetrahedron. And that intrigued me. It's such a unique problem.
They wanted something similar to [Tarodev's "Roll-A-Cube" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9rVZ9mf0uA).

Searching for a pre-existing solution to see if this had been done before turned up nothing.
So I got to work.
Engineering a solution to a unique problem involves trial and error,
and I've purposefully included any non-working attempts so that you can follow along with the process.

For my initial approach, I'll try modifying the Roll-A-Cube code, which uses the [`RotateAround`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.RotateAround.html) method.
But before we get to that, we'll need a 3D model to work with.

## 3D Tetrahedron Model

The requirements I set for myself were the following:

- Edge length of 1 unit (a.k.a. "unit tetrahedron").
- Bottom face is level with the XZ-plane (y = 0).\*
- Top vertex is centered directly above the origin.
- Pointy end forward (though this can easily also point right, not a hard-set constraint).
- Precision is important so I can't rely on downloading someone else's model.

\**Note: This was just for easier math; we will offset it later so the center is at the origin.*

With this setup, I did the math (I will leave the fun of trigonometric computations to the reader) and came out with the following 4 vertices:
```
Back-left: (-0.5, 0, -0.288675)  // z = -sqrt(3)/6
Back-right: (0.5, 0, -0.288675)
Forward:    (0, 0, 0.577350)     // z = 1/sqrt(3)
Top:        (0, 0.816497, 0)     // y = sqrt(2/3)
```

All 4 vertices are `1` unit away from each other and `sqrt(3/8)` units away from the center:

```
 Center is at: (0, 0.2041241, 0) // y = sqrt(6)/12
```

If you want to try deriving it for yourself, I also recommend a linear algebra approach by setting up a few system of equations to solve for the unknowns.
Alternatively, you can check out the [Tetrahedron Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetrahedron#Coordinates_for_a_regular_tetrahedron) for examples, and apply your desired scaling and offset.

With these 4 vertices, we can now create our mesh. How you choose to do this is up to you:
- **3D Modeling Software** (i.e. Blender) - Benefits are: easier customizations like smoothing edges, UV/Texture maps, etc.
- **ProBuilder in Unity** - New Shape > Cone > Radius = 0.5773503, Height = 0.8164966, Sides = 3.
*Note: This didn't feel as accurate and will require modified code to work with later because itâ€™s not a regular `Mesh` but a `ProBuilderMesh`.*
- **Generate Mesh via code** - [I've created a script](https://gist.github.com/Libberator/26c9176e4e51d7a52481ab90175d265d#file-tetrahedronmeshcreator-cs) to generate it for you in one click. 
I purposefully offset the mesh vertices down so that the center is at the origin. This makes it easier for rotating.

Once you have the mesh generated, it's time to set up the GameObject structure.
It's generally a good practice to keep the visuals separate from the logic.
We'll classify the rotation as part of the visuals, but the movement still needs to be applied to the root object.
Set it up with the mesh as a child object, then gave the child's local position the appropriate y-offset.

## RotateAround Approach

[Transform.RotateAround](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.RotateAround.html) requires 3 pieces of information:
- A `Vector3` **axis** to rotate around
- A `Vector3` **point**, a world-space anchor, for which the axis passes through
- A `float` **angle** of rotation in degrees



**Happy rolling!**
